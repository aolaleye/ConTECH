#### Overview:
* The inspiration behind this project came from our experience when beginning UNCC’s Coding Bootcamp. 
* Whenever we searched for an unfamiliar term online, we could easily find ourselves inundated with vast amounts of information.
* We found that it wasn’t just developers that ran into this issue, but also those that worked with developers, such as recruiters.
* __Our app is a quick reference tool that provides simplified definitions to these complex terms.__
* __Our app is for developers, those that work with developers, or anyone that is new to the industry.__

#

#### Technical Components:

    * React.js
    * MongoDB
    * Material-UI
    * an MVC Paradigm folder structure

* __Our application also:__
